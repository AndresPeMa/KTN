# Valentine-Fun
After getting inspired from a Instagram reel, I decided to create this "responsive" and "interactive" way to ask your crush out using HTML, CSS & Js. I ain't
got no girl but this valentine may be you can shoot your shot ;)


If you are unfamiliar with how to run HTML or CSS :
1. Download the repo and open in any code editor
2. Start live server 

Or You can use it Directly by this link:
